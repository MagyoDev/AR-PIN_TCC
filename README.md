## What is AR-Pin?
The AR-Pin app is a tool for learning and exploring the concepts of electronics, Arduino Uno R3, and embedded systems. The app offers interactive features, including educational materials, quizzes, and the ability to view the Arduino Uno R3 and some electronic components in real time using augmented reality, allowing students to learn in an immersive way. One of the project's goals is to make education accessible to everyone. With this in mind, we use a simple color palette with high contrast in our app so that it is easy to use the available content. We use the colors black, white, and red as the main colors. We also opted for a minimalist design with rounded edges combined with simple icons and lines to make the user experience more friendly and fluid.
